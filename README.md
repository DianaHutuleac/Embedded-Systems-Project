The SecureTemp Access System addresses the need for secure access to sensitive environmental data, specifically temperature, in scenarios where restricted access is essential. It ensures that only authorized users can view the temperature readings, enhancing security in environments such as data centers, laboratories, or secure facilities.![image](https://github.com/DianaHutuleac/Embedded-Systems-Project/assets/126680084/5fd7c9f1-f1a3-44fd-a1a2-88ba1df75077)
